![](img/logo.png) **Apache Gearpump** is a real-time big data streaming engine. The name Gearpump is a reference to the engineering term "gear pump" which is a super simple pump that consists of only two gears, but is very powerful at streaming water. Different to other streaming engines, Gearpump's engine is event/message based. Per initial benchmarks we are able to process 18 million messages per second (message length is 100 bytes) with a 8ms latency on a 4-node cluster.
